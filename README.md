- 👋 Hi, I’m @JazzyRock1961. I'm trying to program/internet program an open website for something I call Quorum E-Democracy for any potential "district" to use, but 
specifically focused here in the USA. I explain it all in four videos under ten minutes from when I ran for President in 2020 as a Declarationist:

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above. I designed all kinds of computers and even wrote AI s/w in the 80s and 90s, but it's been decades doing other things. 
I'm 61 and I'm trying to catch up, quickly, to program/internet program QED.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I hope there's a way to do it here, for now. If I get close to anybody, of course I will share, then.
