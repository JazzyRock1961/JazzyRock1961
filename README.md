- 👋 Hi, My name is Oren Clark (JazzyRock1961, here). I'm trying to program/internet-program an limitedly-interactive and open website 
for a political solution I call Quorum E-Democracy for any potential "district"'s citizens/residents to use, but specifically focused here in the USA. 
I explain it all in four videos (under ten minutes) from when I ran for President in 2020 as a Declarationist:

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above. I designed all kinds of computers and even wrote AI s/w in the 80s and 90s, but it's been decades doing other things. 
I'm now 61 and trying to catch up, quickly.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I hope there's a way to do it here, for now. If I get close to anybody, of course I will share, then.
